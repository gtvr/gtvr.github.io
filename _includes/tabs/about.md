### What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual Reality (VR) defines artificial environments that facilitate _immersion_, or putting human senses and intuiting into the environment, the illusion of physical presence.  In practice, VR is implemented in headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive that wrap around and give depth to vision, but VR also includes any technology that enhances immersion or lets us interact with environments on a more human level.  We are exploring these facets and designing new concepts for interaction.
