### What is VR?

Virtual Reality (VR) is interacting with technology in a way that feels _immersive_.  This allows you to place your own senses and intuition in the same space as anything that can happen inside a computer.  We are exploring VR's potential to make the digital more human and designing new concepts for interaction.
