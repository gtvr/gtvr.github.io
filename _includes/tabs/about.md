## Hello!

We are a currently unofficial student organization at Georgia Tech dedicated to the exploration and proliferization of virtual reality technology. We want to spark ideas and have enjoy doing it.

* We:
    * Discuss VR and related (experimental programming) topics
    * Facilitate club and personal projects
    * Conduct tutorials, demos, and talks
    * Share equipment (We have a Vive!)
	* Want to 'hit it big'
